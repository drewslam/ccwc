Step Four

In this step your goal is to support the command line option -m that outputs the number of characters in a file. If the current locale does not support multibyte characters this will match the -c option.

For this one your answer will depend on your locale, so if can, use wc itself and compare the output to your solution:

>wc -m test.txt
  339292 test.txt

>ccwc -m test.txt
  339292 test.txt

If it doesn’t, check your code, fix any bugs and try again. If it does, congratulations! On to…
Step Five

In this step your goal is to support the default option - i.e. no options are provided, which is the equivalent to the -c, -l and -w options. If you’ve done it right your output should match this:

>ccwc test.txt
    7145   58164  342190 test.txt

If it doesn’t, check your code, fix any bugs and try again. If it does, congratulations! On to…
The Final Step

In this step your goal is to support being able to read from standard input if no filename is specified. If you’ve done it right your output should match this:

>cat test.txt | ccwc -l
    7145

If it doesn’t, check your code, fix any bugs and try again. If it does, congratulations! You’ve done it, pat yourself on the back, job well done!
